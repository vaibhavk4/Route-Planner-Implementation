# Route-Planner-Implementation

In this project I have tried to built a route planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map. 

An **A* search algorithm** is been used to find the shortest and the optimized path for the given nodes of map.

We need to import functions written in helpers.py
```
Important Resourses
from helpers import Map, load_map_10, load_map_40, show_map
import math
```
